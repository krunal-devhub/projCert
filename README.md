Project Goal is to deliver the product updatesrequently to production with High quality &
Reliability. They also want to accelerate software delivery speed, quality and reduce feedback time
between developers and testers.
As development progressed, they are facing multiple problems, because of various technologies
involved in the project. Following are the problems:
   Building Complex builds is difficult
   Incremental builds are difficult to manage, and deploy

To solve these problems, they need to implement Continuous Integration & Continuous Deployment with DevOps using following tools:
Git – For version control for tracking changes in the code files
Jenkins – For continuous integration and continuous deployment
Docker – For deploying containerized applications
Ansible - Configuration management tools
This project will be about how to do deploy code to dev/stage/prod etc, just on a click of button.
